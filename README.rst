sfc_gui: GUI For The SFC Models Package
=======================================

Introduction
------------

This package is expected to turn into a graphical interface for the *sfc_models* library. (This is
a library to construct and solve Stock-Flow Consistent models in Python.)

This package is currently prototype code, as I learn how to the use the tk library. The code is
messy, and the output may not look particularly great, and may crash. Basically, use at your own risk.

Pieces of code are based on various online examples. Attribution will be noted within the comments.
Since the code is likely to be completely rebuilt over time, there is no point in putting attributions
within the limited static documentation of the package (e.g., this file).

Documentation is otherwise non-existent; will only be implemented if the GUI elements are stable.

I have no idea how to run unit tests on GUI's; so there is currently no test suite.
